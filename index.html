      Welcome to my personal website! Check out some my projects or my social media accounts!
      <br><br>
      As for myself, I have been programming since I started high school and recently graduated from Allegheny College, double majoring in Computer Science and Political Science.
      I love how coding can both provide enjoyment and challenge, creating a desirable mix that helps drive my passion.
      Looking forward, I am excited to continue my knowledge in all areas of software development, particularly learning new languages and tools to use.
      Feel free to contribute to my repositories or post issues for any bugs you encounter or features you would like to see!
